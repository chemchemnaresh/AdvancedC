***Binary Search Tree***
         
               Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
              
               -The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key.
               -The right subtree of a nide contains only nodes with keys greater the node's key.
               -The left and right subtree each must also be a binary serach tree.
                                                                     

   Binary search tree look like This:

                           50
                         /    \
                        30     90
                       / \       \
                      20  40     100 

  Terms
    
      Node any ithem that is stored in the tree.ROOT the top item in the tree.(50 in the tree abiove) Child Node(s) 
      under the current node.(20 and 40 are children of 30 in the tree above) parent the node directly above the 
      current node.(90 is the parent of 100 in the tree) Leaf A node which has no children.(20 is a leaf in the tree).
