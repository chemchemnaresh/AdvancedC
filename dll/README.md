<h1>Double Linked List</h1>

A Double linked list is a linear data structure which is capble to traverse in forward direction as well as backward 
direction .

   Every node in double linked list  contains three parts
   1.information
   2.addition of next node
   3.Adress of previous node
   
   The last node of double linked list *next should be NULL indicatinf end of linked list.

   The first node of double linked list *prev should be NULL indicating end of linked list.

   Each node points to not only successor but the predecessor.
  
   There are two NULL: at the first and lost nodes in the list.

   Advantage:give a node, it is easy to visit its predecessor convenient to traverse list backwards.
